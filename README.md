# Prework Study Guide: Sangki Jun

## Description

This prework study guide was created with two purposes: to provide a meaningful study guide for boot camp students who are learning from the prework, and to teach myself basic coding skills. It solves having to go through multiple modules and their pages to find relevant information to remember. In creating this site, I learned basic HTML, CSS, git commands, and JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This study guide page contains one visible and one hidden feature. The first visible one are the notes written on the page copied directly from the prework modules which are divided into four sections. The second hidden one is within the console which can be accessed by right-clicking anywhere on the page, selecting "inspect" on the bottom of the listed options, and swithcing to the "console" tab next to "elements" on the top. The console lists the four section titles on the visible page as well as a random generator that suggests a different section to study everytime the page is refreshed.

## Credits

I would like to thank my tutor Andres Long for helping through Module 2.4.6 and tutoring through the git work flow
